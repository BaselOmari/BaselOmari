# 👋 Hey there! I'm Bassel

I'm a senior Computer Engineering student at the **University of Waterloo**, passionate about **Machine Learning**, **Systems Engineering**, and building scalable real-world solutions. From cutting-edge research labs to industry-leading companies, I've tackled diverse challenges and collaborated with world-class teams.

Whether it's reducing motion forecasting error in autonomous trucks or boosting robotic assembly using GNNs, I love pushing the boundaries of what's possible with technology. I'm currently looking for **new graduate roles starting in 2025** — feel free to connect!
